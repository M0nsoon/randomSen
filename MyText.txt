Here is what you need to do in order to continue browsing my profile.

If you read the TOS of Reddit you'd know that I have the right to my personal information and the content of my profile. So, if you'd like to continue browsing my profile you must first give this post (or any of my other posts) platinum.
And no, I don't mean silver. And no, I don't mean gold. Only platinums.
I'm trying to break the Reddit record for having the biggest gold:platinum ratio so golds would ruin it.
One more time just to be clear, and if you would like to continue browsing my profile, give this post platinum.
And no, you are not allowed to continue browsing my profile without gilding this (or any of my other posts).
I won't bother you with the legal techicalities which most of you probably won't understand anyways, but when you agreed to the Reddit TOS you also agreed to not violate anyone's personal information.
Thank you in advance for the platinums.
(no golds or silvers please).

edit: silvers are actually okay as they do not hurt the ratio of platinums to golds.
 Though I do not care about them.
